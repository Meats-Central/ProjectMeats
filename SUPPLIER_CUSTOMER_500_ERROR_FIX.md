# Fix for 500 Error When Creating Suppliers/Customers

## Problem Statement
When adding a new supplier or customer in development mode as admin, users encountered the error:
```
Failed to save supplier: Failed to create supplier: Request failed with status code 500
```

## Root Cause
The serializers (`SupplierSerializer` and `CustomerSerializer`) were missing fields that had been added to the models in migrations `0004` and `0005`. When the API received requests containing these new fields, the serializers couldn't handle them, resulting in a 500 Internal Server Error.

## Solution
Updated both serializers to include all model fields that were added in recent migrations.

### Files Changed
1. `backend/apps/suppliers/serializers.py` - Added 7 missing fields
2. `backend/apps/customers/serializers.py` - Added 8 missing fields
3. `copilot-log.md` - Documented the fix and lessons learned

### Supplier Serializer - Added Fields
- `account_line_of_credit` - Line of credit amount range
- `accounting_payment_terms` - Payment terms (Wire, ACH, Check, etc.)
- `credit_limits` - Credit limits/terms (Net 30, Net 45, etc.)
- `departments` - Departments (Sales, BOL, COA, etc.)
- `fresh_or_frozen` - Product state (Fresh or Frozen)
- `net_or_catch` - Weight type (Net or Catch)
- `package_type` - Package type (Boxed wax lined, Combo bins, etc.)

### Customer Serializer - Added Fields
- `account_line_of_credit` - Line of credit amount range
- `accounting_payment_terms` - Payment terms (Wire, ACH, Check, etc.)
- `credit_limits` - Credit limits/terms (Net 30, Net 45, etc.)
- `buyer_contact_name` - Buyer contact name
- `buyer_contact_phone` - Buyer contact phone
- `buyer_contact_email` - Buyer contact email
- `product_exportable` - Does customer require exportable products?
- `type_of_certificate` - Certificate type required (BRC, SQF, etc.)

## Testing
All existing tests pass successfully:
- ✅ 10 unit tests for supplier and customer API endpoints
- ✅ Django system checks pass with no issues
- ✅ Serializer validation confirmed for both minimal and full field sets

## Verification
To verify the fix works, the serializers now correctly accept and validate data like:

**Supplier Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "ABC Meats Inc.",
  "accounting_payment_terms": "Wire",
  "credit_limits": "Net 30",
  "account_line_of_credit": "$100,000 - $250,000",
  "fresh_or_frozen": "Fresh",
  "package_type": "Boxed wax lined",
  "net_or_catch": "Net",
  "departments": "Sales, BOL, COA"
}
```

**Customer Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "XYZ Foods LLC",
  "accounting_payment_terms": "ACH",
  "credit_limits": "Net 45",
  "account_line_of_credit": "$500,000 - $1,000,000",
  "buyer_contact_name": "Jane Buyer",
  "buyer_contact_phone": "555-1111",
  "buyer_contact_email": "jane@xyzfoods.com",
  "product_exportable": true,
  "type_of_certificate": "BRC"
}
```

## Lessons Learned
1. **Always update serializers when adding model fields** - When migrations add new fields to models, the corresponding serializers must be updated to include those fields
2. **Use the component update checklist** - Follow the checklist in the custom instructions to ensure all related components (models, admin, serializers, views, forms, templates) are updated together
3. **Programmatic field comparison** - Using Python to compare model fields vs serializer fields helps identify mismatches quickly
4. **Test with actual data** - Integration tests should include creation with full field sets, not just minimal data

## Prevention
To prevent this issue in the future:
1. Add a CI check that compares model fields vs serializer fields
2. Create a management command to verify model-serializer field alignment
3. Update migration generation workflow to remind developers to update serializers
4. Add integration tests that test creation with all available fields

## Impact
This fix resolves the 500 error completely. Users can now create suppliers and customers with all available fields without encountering server errors.
