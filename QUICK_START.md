## ✅ Deployment Checklist

### Development (Already Done ✅)
- [x] Tested locally
- [x] Supplier creation works
- [x] No 403/500 errors

### Staging (After PR Merge)
```bash
# SSH into staging server
ssh staging.meatscentral.com

# Pull latest
cd /app
git pull origin main

# Verify DEBUG=False
python manage.py shell -c "from django.conf import settings; print(settings.DEBUG)"
# Must show: False

# Restart
systemctl restart gunicorn

# Test (should require auth)
curl -X POST https://uat.meatscentral.com/api/v1/suppliers/
# Expected: 401 or 403
```

### Production (After Staging Verification)
Same as staging, but:
- Use production URL
- More careful monitoring
- Rollback plan ready

## 🔒 Security Verification

```bash
# ✅ Development
DEBUG=True → Auth bypass ACTIVE

# ✅ Staging
DEBUG=False → Auth REQUIRED

# ✅ Production
DEBUG=False → Auth REQUIRED
```

## 📊 Files Changed (Summary)

| File | Changes | Impact |
|------|---------|--------|
| `suppliers/views.py` | +100 lines | Dev auth bypass |
| `businessApi.ts` | +10 lines | Better error handling |
| Docs (3 files) | New files | Documentation |

## 🎯 Key Points

✅ **Safe for production** - All bypasses are DEBUG-gated  
✅ **Zero breaking changes** - Existing flows unaffected  
✅ **Better dev experience** - No auth setup needed locally  
✅ **Well documented** - Comprehensive docs included  

## ⚠️ Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER set DEBUG=True in production**
2. **Always verify DEBUG=False** after deploying to staging/prod
3. **Test authentication requirement** in staging before production
