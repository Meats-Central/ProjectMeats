## Admin Interface Updates

Updated admin configurations for all models to include:

- Updated fieldsets for better organization
- Added filter_horizontal for ManyToMany relationships
- Added raw_id_fields for ForeignKey relationships to improve performance

Apps updated:
- customers/admin.py
- suppliers/admin.py
- carriers/admin.py
- contacts/admin.py
- plants/admin.py
- purchase_orders/admin.py
- products/admin.py (new)

- invoices/admin.py (new)

## API Serializers

Created/updated serializers for all models:
- products/serializers.py (new) - ProductSerializer
- sales_orders/serializers.py (new) - SalesOrderSerializer with related entity names
- invoices/serializers.py (new) - InvoiceSerializer with related entity names

## Settings Updates

Added new apps to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `backend/projectmeats/settings/base.py`:
- apps.products
- apps.sales_orders
- apps.invoices

## Backward Compatibility

Deprecated fields have been retained for backward compatibility:
- Supplier: `accounting_terms`, `accounting_line_of_credit`
- Customer: `accounting_terms`, `accounting_line_of_credit`

These fields are marked as deprecated in their help text and should be replaced with the new standardized fields in the future.

## Testing

All changes have been tested:
- Django check: ✓ No errors
- Migrations: ✓ All applied successfully
- Model validation: ✓ Passed

## Deployment Notes

For deployment to dev, UAT, and production:
1. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply all migrations
2. Update any custom queries or filters that may rely on old field structures
3. The new apps (products, sales_orders, invoices) will be available immediately
4. Review and update any existing scripts or integrations that use the modified models

## Future Improvements

Consider:
1. Creating data migration scripts to populate deprecated fields from new fields
2. Adding model methods to calculate derived values
3. Implementing custom managers for common queries
4. Adding model validation for business rules
5. Creating API views and viewsets for the new models
6. Adding comprehensive unit tests for all new functionality
