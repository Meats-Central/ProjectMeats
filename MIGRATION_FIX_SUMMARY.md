# Migration Dependency Fix Summary

## Problem Statement

GitHub Actions deployment pipeline was failing with:
```
django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: 
Migration purchase_orders.0004_alter_purchaseorder_carrier_release_format_and_more 
is applied before its dependency sales_orders.0002_alter_salesorder_carrier_release_num_and_more 
on database 'default'.
```

**Failed Run:** https://github.com/Meats-Central/ProjectMeats/actions/runs/18547306185/job/52867765684

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Migration Timeline:**
   - `sales_orders.0002` generated: 2025-10-13 05:23
   - `purchase_orders.0004` generated: 2025-10-13 06:30 (later)

2. **Dependency Issue:**
   - `purchase_orders.0004` had a dependency on `sales_orders.0002`
   - In the database, `purchase_orders.0004` was already applied
   - But `sales_orders.0002` was not yet applied
   - This created an inconsistent migration history

3. **Why the dependency was unnecessary:**
   - `purchase_orders.0004` creates `ColdStorageEntry` model with ForeignKey to `SalesOrder`
   - `SalesOrder` model is created in `sales_orders.0001_initial`
   - `sales_orders.0002` only adds defaults to existing fields (no model structure changes)
   - Therefore, `purchase_orders.0004` only needs `sales_orders.0001`, not `0002`

## Solution

**Single-line change** in `backend/apps/purchase_orders/migrations/0004_alter_purchaseorder_carrier_release_format_and_more.py`:

```python
# Line 15: Changed from
("sales_orders", "0002_alter_salesorder_carrier_release_num_and_more"),

# To
("sales_orders", "0001_initial"),
```

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ **Migration plan validation:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate --plan
   # Verified correct order: sales_orders.0001 → purchase_orders.0004 → sales_orders.0002
   ```

2. ✅ **Fresh database test (run twice):**
   ```bash
   rm db.sqlite3
   python manage.py migrate
   # All migrations applied successfully in correct order
   ```

3. ✅ **No unapplied migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
   # Output: No changes detected
   ```

4. ✅ **Database check:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py check --database default
   # Output: System check identified no issues
   ```

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Migration dependency corrected from sales_orders.0002 to 0001
- [x] Migrations run successfully from fresh database
- [x] No InconsistentMigrationHistory errors
- [x] Correct migration order verified with --plan
- [x] All migrations show as applied
- [x] No new unapplied migrations detected
- [x] Database system check passes
- [x] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [x] copilot-log.md updated with detailed task log
- [x] .gitignore updated to prevent test file commits

## Impact

### Benefits
- ✅ Unblocks deployment pipeline
- ✅ Allows migrations to run in correct order
- ✅ Prevents InconsistentMigrationHistory exception
- ✅ Minimal change (1 line) reduces risk

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Level:** Very Low
- **Reason:** Only changes dependency ordering, no database schema changes
- **Compatibility:** Works for both fresh databases and existing deployments

## Files Changed

1. **backend/apps/purchase_orders/migrations/0004_*.py** - Fixed dependency (1 line)
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Documented the fix
3. **copilot-log.md** - Added detailed task log with lessons learned
4. **backend/.gitignore** - Added db.sqlite3 and .env

## Commits

1. `833189d` - Fix migration dependency: change sales_orders.0002 to 0001 in purchase_orders.0004
2. `7592be6` - Update documentation: add migration fix to CHANGELOG and copilot-log
3. `febefb3` - Update backend/.gitignore to exclude db.sqlite3 and .env

## Next Steps

1. Merge this PR to fix the deployment pipeline
2. Re-run failed GitHub Actions workflow to verify fix
3. Monitor deployment logs to confirm migrations apply successfully
4. No manual database intervention required (fix handles both scenarios)
