- All 6 tests passed successfully

### 8. Documentation
Created detailed documentation:
- DATA_MODEL_ENHANCEMENTS.md with complete field listing
- Migration details

- Future improvement suggestions

## Technical Details

### Backward Compatibility
Maintained by keeping deprecated fields:
- Supplier: `accounting_terms`, `accounting_line_of_credit`
- Customer: `accounting_terms`, `accounting_line_of_credit`

These are marked as deprecated in help text and should be migrated to new standardized fields.

### Settings Updates
Added 3 new apps to INSTALLED_APPS:
- apps.products
- apps.sales_orders
- apps.invoices

### Code Quality
- All changes follow Django best practices
- Proper use of choices for standardized fields
- Comprehensive help text on all fields
- Proper ForeignKey and ManyToMany relationships
- TimestampModel inheritance for audit trails
- TenantManager for multi-tenancy support

## Validation Results

### Django Checks
- System check: ✓ Passed
- No model-related issues
- Only expected deployment security warnings

### Migrations
- All migrations applied successfully
- No data loss
- Proper handling of nullable fields for existing data

### Tests
- 6/6 unit tests passed
- Models create correctly
- String representations work as expected
- Relationships function properly

## Deployment Notes

For deployment to dev.meatscentral.com, uat.meatscentral.com, and prod.meatscentral.com:

1. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Verify in admin interface**:
   - All new fields should be visible
   - All new apps (Products, Sales Orders, Invoices) should appear
   - Filtering and searching should work with new fields

3. **Update any custom code**:
   - Check for hardcoded field references
   - Update API consumers to use new fields
   - Consider migrating from deprecated fields

4. **No breaking changes**:
   - All existing functionality preserved
   - New fields are optional (blank=True)
   - Deprecated fields still work

## Metrics
