# Django ALLOWED_HOSTS Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Django application was experiencing `DisallowedHost` errors in production when deployed on Digital Ocean App Platform:

```
django.core.exceptions.DisallowedHost: Invalid HTTP_HOST header: '10.244.45.4:8080'. You may need to add '10.244.45.4' to ALLOWED_HOSTS.
```

This was causing health check endpoints to fail with 500 errors instead of returning successful responses.

## Root Cause
Digital Ocean App Platform (and other container orchestration platforms) perform health checks using internal container IP addresses (like `10.244.45.4:8080`) rather than the external domain names. The Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting was only configured with external domain names, causing these internal health check requests to be rejected.

## Solution
Modified the production Django settings (`backend/projectmeats/settings/production.py`) to:

1. **Fixed ALLOWED_HOSTS parsing logic** - Properly handle comma-separated environment variables
2. **Added support for internal container IPs** - Include common internal IP patterns used by container platforms
3. **Added INTERNAL_ALLOWED_HOSTS environment variable** - Allow platform-specific internal IPs to be configured
4. **Updated deployment configuration** - Modified `app.yaml` to pass internal IPs via environment variables

### Changes Made

#### backend/projectmeats/settings/production.py
- Fixed ALLOWED_HOSTS parsing from environment variables
- Added support for `INTERNAL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable
- Included common internal IP patterns for container environments
- Specifically added `10.244.45.4` which was causing the errors

#### app.yaml
- Added `INTERNAL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` environment variable with container-specific IPs

## Verification
Created comprehensive tests in `test_allowed_hosts_fix.py` that verify:
- ALLOWED_HOSTS correctly parses environment variables
- Internal container IPs are properly included
- The specific problematic IP (10.244.45.4) is handled
- CSRF and session middleware configuration is correct

## Security Considerations
- Only includes specific internal IP addresses, not wildcards
- Maintains strict external domain validation
- Does not compromise production security posture
- Internal IPs are only accessible from within the container network

## Testing
Run the validation tests:
```bash
cd backend
python test_allowed_hosts_fix.py
```

Or with Django's test framework:
```bash
python manage.py test test_allowed_hosts_fix
```
